# Machine Learning for Sepsis Detection

The goal of this project is to detect sepsis in patients using machine learning algorithms applied to their clinical data.

## Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's immune response to an infection causes harm to its own tissues and organs. Early detection of sepsis is essential for improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the onset of sepsis in patients by analyzing their clinical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the PhysioNet Challenge of Sepsis. It includes deidentified health data from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of two large hospitals. The dataset contains vital signs, laboratory measurements, and other clinical data.

## Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes various preprocessing steps before training the machine learning models. These steps include handling missing data, imputing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and normalizing data.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is a crucial step in any machine learning project. This project uses several techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the most relevant features for sepsis detection.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The project employs several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and random forest. The models undergo hyperparameter tuning to obtain the best possible results.

## Evaluation Metrics

The project uses several evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.

## Conclusion

This sepsis detection project demonstrates the potential of using machine learning algorithms to predict the onset of sepsis in patients. The results obtained from the various models can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care.
